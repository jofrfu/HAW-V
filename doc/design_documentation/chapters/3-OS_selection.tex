\chapter{OS Selection}

\section{Operating System}

For our project we need an Operating System which is free, doesn't need many ressources and is easy to extend. Because we don't have the ability and time to write our own OS, we decided to use an existing open source OS. 

\section{Available Operating Systems}

In our first meeting we figured out which Operating Systems are available for our project and the outcome was:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Linux
	\item BSD
	\item Riot
	\item Minix 
\end{itemize}
Linux and FreeBSD are way to huge and it would take to much time to customize it for our needs.\\
Riot as an OS which is partly invented at the HAW would be a great one to use.\\
But we decided to use the Minix OS because it is very small and light weighted, well documented and easy to extend.\\
Aditionally Minix as an Operating System for teaching perfectly fits to our project.
